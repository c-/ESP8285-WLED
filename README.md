This is a WLED board built around an ESP-8285, designed to be milled on
a CNC.

Parts include the ESP8285, a PCB trace antenna, an optional external
antenna connector, CH340K USB controller (with support for ESP
auto-programming), TXS0101 level shifter, an ME3115
buck converter (for WS2811 projects), and a ME6211 3.3V LDO. This stuff
is, for the most part, straight out of the data sheets so there shouldn't
be anything too exciting.
